The deployment workflow uses the deployer package [deployer-extended](https://github.com/sourcebroker/deployer-extended) as basis. 

## Installation

The default configuration for TYPO3 applications are located at [set.php](../deployer/typo3/config/set.php) and can be optionally overwritten.

If you want to use the TYPO3 deployment functionalities add the belonging autoloader to your project `deploy.php`:

```php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/xima/xima-deployer-tools/deployer/typo3/autoload.php');
```

See an example configuration here: [typo3 example](../deployer/typo3/example/).

## Tasks

The following tasks are TYPO3 specific and extend the default deployer deployment:

### Default deployment

The default deployment task for TYPO3 applications can be found here  [deploy.php](../deployer/typo3/task/deploy.php)

### Clearing the cache

```bash
dep deploy:cache:clear
```

### Warming the cache

```bash
dep deploy:cache:warmup
```

### Clearing and warming the cache
Clearing and warming the cache in one combined task

```bash
dep deploy:cache:clear_and_warmup
```

### Updating the database

```

### Backup database

By default a database dump is created on deployments to prod environment. The default configuration file used by the task is:

```bash

To disable the database backup you can disable the task like this:
```bash
task('database:backup')->disable();
```
